      <h1>How to Build Your Personal Knowledge Management System</h1>
      <h2>What is PKM & Why you need it?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a collection of processes that a
        person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share
        knowledge in their daily activities (Grundspenkis 2007) and the way in
        which these processes support work activities (Wright 2005). It is a
        response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for
        their own growth and learning (Smedley 2009). It is a bottom-up approach
        to knowledge management (KM) (Pollard 2008).”

          <p>
            <b>Data</b> is just a set of signals or symbols. Nothing more — just
            noise.
          </p>
          <p>You get <b>Information</b> when you start to make data useful.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Knowledge</b> allows us to detect patterns based on the
            information we get.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Wisdom</b> allows us to predict the future correctly, not only by
            detecting and understanding patterns but also deeply comprehending
            the “Why” behind those patterns.

      <h2>The 4C Process</h2>
      <h3>Capture</h3>
      <p><b>Collect & Store</b></p>
      <p>
        Collect information is the first step for you to build up your Personal
        Knowledge System. These information resource could be: news letter, blog
        posts, tweets, books, scienticifc papers, note from conference etc.
        After collecting, I will store them in Pocket or Notion for next step.
      </p>

      <h3>Curate</h3>
      <p>
        Classify & Organize I stored all the information in one place -- Notion.
        I read most of the articles when I was in rush. I add them to Pocket for
        a more deeper reading. If the articles are worth noting. I will send
        them to Notion. Every few months, I will go through my knowledge base in
        Notion and clean it up. Remove the information is not relevant or out
        dated. Add labels or merge some notes together.
      </p>
      <h3>Crunch</h3>
      <p>
        Revise & Review Information stored in Notion is not your knowledge yet.
        They are in your “Second brain” and stay there. Review some knowledges
        or retrieve them regularly until you master them. Revise existing
        information when new information added to you knowledge. Does it help
        you to understand this topic, or do you need update the old one?
      </p>
      <h3>Contribution</h3>
      <p>Utilize & Sharing</p>
      <p>The last part of the PKM is to use your knowledge or sharing them.</p>

      <p>
        Using your knowledge is a way to help you transfer knowledge to wisdom
        and help your future work or life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharing knowledge helps you to understand the knowledge better by
        transferring the knowledge to others.
