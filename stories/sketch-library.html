      <h1>Build your Sketch Library for Fast Prototyping</h1>
      <p>
        Draw your design on paper, take pictures and import to a prototyping
        tool, add a link to each page, show it to the stakeholder and they will
        give you this face üßê.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paper prototyping can be rough, abstract, and hard to understand. So‚Ä¶
        you to want build high-fidelity prototypes? Here are some problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You need to spend a lot of time on design decisions, not on solving
          the real problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Product requirements change faster than your prototype; what you
          designed would be trashed before it gets presented to product owners.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How about trying to build a faster high-fidelity prototype next time,
        with powerful Sketch Libraries?
      </p>
      <h2>A quick look of Sketch Libraries</h2>
      <h3>What is Sketch Libraries?</h3>

      <p>
        Sketch Libraries are just ordinary Sketch documents that contain
        Symbols. However, Libraries are cross-document symbols, which means you
        can use these symbols across all your Sketch documents.
      </p>

      <h3>Why do Sketch Libraries matter?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          In order to keep your design consistent in different design files‚Ä¶
          especially when you start collaborating with other designers. You need
          a single source of truth to relay on: what you changed in the Library
          will also change in other files.
        </li>
        <li>
          You probably used other online wireframe tools to do rapid
          prototyping. If you think about it, those tools are just libraries
          which contain all the components you need to build a prototype
          quickly. So why not just build one by yourself?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Build your first Sketch¬†Library</h2>

      <p>
        When you start building the sketch library, it&#8217;s more like making
        (not playing) Lego. It&#8217;s not the fun part, but it&#8217;s a very
        important step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like Lego, one library can use another library to build a more
        complex one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sketch has a document about how to build the library, and I would
        recommend starting there. Here are some tips for building the Library.
      </p>

      <h3>Mono Library or Multi-Library</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Mono library</strong> includes all the components in a single
        file. The benefit of mono libraries are that it&#8217;s easy to mange,
        as only one file is needed to be imported into Sketch Library. However
        when your library starts growing, it can also be hard to maintain.
        Another reason to avoid mono libraries is that your symbols selection in
        Sketch will be huge (although you can of course use plugins to insert
        symbols).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Multi-library</strong> makes each file smaller, and it is easier
        to maintain in the future. There are also drawbacks: If one library uses
        another library, both libraries need to be updated. In Kotti Design
        System<sup>1</sup>, we found that the multi-library architecture is more
        suitable for us.
      </p>

      <h3>Structured Nest¬†Library</h3>

      <img src="/images/sl-01.png" class="wide" />

      <p>
        Sketch allows nested symbols, so we can use this feature to build a
        nested library. Kotti Color is in the bottom of the hierarchy, and Kotti
        Icon and Kotti Typography rely on it. It makes changing the color of
        icons or text easier. Other components depending on Kotti Icon and Kotti
        Typography makes quickly changing the icon and font type super fast.
      </p>

      <h2>The End‚Ä¶</h2>

      <p>
        We ed our first library when Sketch launched this feature. We spent a
        few days to convert all the symbols into libraries. Yes it&#8217;s a
        tedious process, but the benefits are huge:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For small features (2‚Äì3 views) we can build the prototype in 2 hours
          and it can be used for collecting customer feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
          For projects we&#8217;re still using paper prototype in the early
          stage for fast design iteration. Then we switch to Sketch‚Ää-‚ÄäFull Speed
          On.
        </li>
      </ul>
