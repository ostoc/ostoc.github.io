# 🪭 Berlin CSD 2024 🌈

<img class="filter" src="/images/csd-24.png"  />

🌹 You can buy yourself flowers and take yourself dancing 🕺. But why not dance and celebrate the pride together! 👯‍♀️ 

🌈 It's the time of the year *again* and we are gathering to *express your inner gayness* of you. 💅

<a class="button" href="https://t.me/+QaTYcHpv3qgwNWM6">💬 Join the Telegram Group</a>

<div class="callout">

The group becomes bigger and bigger, that's amazing! However, it's fun to dance and celebrating all together, but no fun for endless waiting and re-grouping. 

<b><u>We'd suggest you follow your own pace (or music) and use the plan and Telegram to form your own dancing group.</u></b>

Enjoy! It's boring to dance alone! 😘

### Pickup Points

We will follow the same logistic as last year. Feel free to join us at any pick-up point. Looking forward to seeing you 💋

**1. Uniqlo Postdamer Platz 🛍️**

Let's kick off our adventure at Uniqlo Postdamer Platz! It's a spot with a lovely park and plenty of shade right in front of the shop. And if you need a quick refreshment, head over to the Mall of Berlin or GoAsia market for some drinks!

**2. Getränke Hoffmann 🍺**

Next up, we'll meet at Getränke Hoffmann, the ultimate destination for replenishing your energy with drinks and food. It's a little off the beaten path, making it the perfect spot to meet and enjoy each other's company.

**3. Siegessäule ✌️**

We'll take a moment to rest and gather near Victory Column, snap some fantastic photos, and then contiune dance along with the crowd to the Brandenburger Tor.

### Rendezvous

We will have a Rendezvous once we enter the final rally area this year. 

It's located in the middle of the Straße Des 17. Juni. We will try to meet there every hour, which means at 20:00, 21:00, and 22:00, you could find our group chilling ~or peeing 🔫~ there.

### After Party

Exiting the CSD is a lively adventure! 

This year, we've planned our after-party at [Jonny Knüppel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Kk7L79GRehJeTCGt6)!! Once the celebration wraps up, we'll head to Hauptbahnhof and catch the M10, which will take us straight to the club.

*Hope you enjoy this year's plan 😘*


*With Love, from JP*
