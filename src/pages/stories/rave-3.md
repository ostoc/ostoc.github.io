# 🪩 B-day Lake Rave, Vol.3 

<img class="filter" src="/images/rave.png"  />

Dear friends and friend's friends,

After 2 years of great together and so much fun. We are excited to announce that we'll see each other again by the lake and create another unforgetable memories.

For this year, we'd like to add a little bit theme and fun to the party. 

🥁🥁🥁 Durm, durm, durm 

During the day, the theme will be Beach Splash 💦 -- Get your Hawaii shirt, swiming trunks and bikini, we'd like to see you getting tanned on the beach, getting wet in the lake while sipping your Apreol Spritz. Music will be chill and relax, great time for outdoor activities and catching up with others.

🪩🪩🪩 Bling, bling, bling

During the night, let's Neon 🏮 it up. Getting your neon cloth, strips, or skirts. Shining like a porn star in the dark light. From house to techno, to trance, we will party till the sun rise or police come.

Yours,

Orestis & Junyu

## Info

*So gald that you decided to join us for a ~small~ party. To make sure you will have a great time with us. Here are some tips for a lake rave.*

📆 **We will be there from 14:00 till next morning. Music starts at 17:00.**

**💦 Tip 1: Bring enough water for yourself**

Staying hydrated is important! Please bring at least 2 liters of water for yourself. If you have extra space, bring another liter of water for other ravers. We are ravers because we care!

**🧥 Tip 2: If you want to stay overnight, bring warm clothes**

It’s German summer, so the nights can get cold. Bring long pants and a sweater (jacket) to stay warm. Otherwise, you will have to dance all night to keep warm.

**🍹 Tip 3: Bring enough drinks to get you into the rave mood**

There is no Späti to buy drinks in nature. If your fun relies on alcohol, bring enough drinks to get yourself into that mood. If you want to be popular at the party, sharing your drinks is always a good idea.

**🧺 Tip 4: Bring a towel or blanket**

If you’d like to swim in the lake or stay until the next morning, a towel is a must. It can be used for drying your body and can also serve as an extra layer when it’s cold.

**🌭 Tip 5: If you are a snacker and get hungry easily, bring some food**

There will be no restaurants in nature. If you get hungry easily, bring some food for yourself. Sharing is caring and makes you popular—bringing food for others is always welcome.

**🔐 Tip 6: Keep your belongings safe**

We did better last year, nothing got stolen. However, better be safe than sorry. Make sure your belongings are placed in a secure location.

**❄️ Tip 7: Have fun but also be respectful**

You will be in a public space. We’d appreciate it if certain things stay hidden until darkness. This doesn’t mean you can’t swim naked -- that we encourage it.
