# 👗 Berlin CSD 2025 🌈

<img class="contrast" src="/images/csd-25.png"/>

**Three years in a row — we’re back together for Pride again!**

The plan hasn’t changed much.

Last year, we introduced a rendezvous point — but we ended up waiting around too long.
This year, we’ll go with the flow. Let’s enjoy the music and dance like yourself.
We’ll find each other in the crowd — while you’re dancing.

We suggest moving at your own pace (or to your own beat) and regrouping at the pickup points.

Enjoy! Dancing alone is boring 😘

Feel free to join us at any pick-up point. Looking forward to seeing you 💋

**1. Uniqlo Postdamer Platz 🛍️**

It's a spot with a lovely park (~peeing people~) and plenty of shade right in front of the shop. And if you need a quick refreshment, head over to the Mall of Berlin or GoAsia market for some drinks!

**2. Getränke Hoffmann 🍺**

Getränke Hoffmann -- the ultimate destination for replenishing your energy with drinks and food. It's a little off the beaten path, making it the perfect spot to meet up.

**3. Siegessäule ✌️**

It's photo time!!

We'll take a moment to rest and gather near Siegessäule, snap some photos, and then contiune dance along with the crowd to the Brandenburger Tor. _Btw. the link contains correct location :D_

*Hope you enjoy this year's plan 😘*

*With Love, from JP*
