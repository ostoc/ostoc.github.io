**1. Uniqlo Postdamer Platz 🛍️**

Let's kick off our adventure at Uniqlo Postdamer Platz! It's a spot with a lovely park and plenty of shade right in front of the shop. And if you need a quick refreshment, head over to the Mall of Berlin or GoAsia market for some drinks!

**2. Getränke Hoffmann 🍺**

Next up, we'll meet at Getränke Hoffmann, the ultimate destination for replenishing your energy with drinks and food. It's a little off the beaten path, making it the perfect spot to meet and enjoy each other's company.

**3. Café Viktoria Siegessäule ✌️**

We'll take a moment to rest and gather near Victory Column, snap some fantastic photos, and then contiune dance along with the crowd to the Brandenburger Tor.

**4. T-34 Tank 🎽**

As the day continues, get ready for an amazing show right in front of the Brandenburger Tor. Get your dancing shoes on because you won't be able to resist moving and grooving to the music. 

After the show, let's regroup at the T-34 Tank. From there, we'll head to the after-party from U-Bahn Bundestag. Get ready to keep the cheerful spirit alive as we continue the festivities into the night!
