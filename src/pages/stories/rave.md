*General information*

- 📅 **2024-06-01**, opening hours all day and night.
- 📍 **Flughafensee**, accurate location will be update once we are set. 


*Sidenotes*
- 🔖 Don't use Telegram? Bookmark this page, we will update all the information you needed later.
- 🧺 As denoted in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: *A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.* You can use it as a bag to carry beverages and food, you can use it as a skirt for the dance floor, you can use it to fight off a wild boar at night, you can sit on it if it rains you can sit under it.
- ❄️ **We’d appreciate it if certain things stay hidden till darkness** — it doesn’t mean you can’t swim naked, that we encourage.


*Yours,*

**Orestis & Junyu**
