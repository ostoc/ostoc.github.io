Dear friends and friends of friends,

After two years of great times and so much fun together, we are excited to share that we'll see each other again by the lake to create more unforgettable memories!

For this year, we'd like to add a little theme and extra fun to the party.

<!-- <div class="callout"> -->
**During the day 💦**

> The theme will be **Beach Splash** ! Get out your Hawaiian shirts, swimming trunks, and bikinis. We'd like to see you getting tanned on the beach and getting wet in the lake while sipping your Aperol Spritz. The music will be chill and relaxed – a great time for outdoor activities and catching up with everyone.

**As night falls 🪩**
> Let's **Neon** it up! Get out your neon clothes, strips, or skirts. We will also get neon paint and black light. You can shine like a porn star in the dark! From house to techno to trance, we will party till the sun rises or the police come.

<!-- </div> -->



See you there!

Yours,

Orestis & Junyu

### Tips

*To make sure you will have a great time with us. Here are some tips for a lake rave.*

📆 **We will be there from June 7th 14:00, till next morning. Music starts at 17:00. Come early, let's play some frisbee 🥏**

**💦 Tip 1: Bring enough water for yourself**

Staying hydrated is important! Please bring at least 2 liters of water for yourself. If you have extra space, bring another liter of water for other ravers. We are ravers because we care!

**🧥 Tip 2: If you want to stay overnight, bring warm clothes**

It’s German summer, so the nights can get cold. Bring long pants and a sweater (jacket) to stay warm. Otherwise, you will have to dance all night to keep warm.

**🍹 Tip 3: Bring enough drinks to get you into the rave mood**

There is no Späti to buy drinks in nature. If your fun relies on alcohol, bring enough drinks to get yourself into that mood. If you want to be popular at the party, sharing your drinks is always a good idea.

**🧺 Tip 4: Bring a towel or blanket**

If you’d like to swim in the lake or stay until the next morning, a towel is a must. It can be used for drying your body and can also serve as an extra layer when it’s cold.

**🌭 Tip 5: If you are a snacker and get hungry easily, bring some food**

There will be no restaurants in nature. If you get hungry easily, bring some food for yourself. Sharing is caring and makes you popular—bringing food for others is always welcome.

**🔐 Tip 6: Keep your belongings safe**

We did better last year, nothing got stolen. However, better be safe than sorry. Make sure your belongings are placed in a secure location.

**❄️ Tip 7: Have fun but also be respectful**

You will be in a public space. We’d appreciate it if certain things stay hidden until darkness. This doesn’t mean you can’t swim naked -- that we encourage it.
