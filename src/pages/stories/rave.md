## Info

*So gald that you will join us for a small party. To make sure you will have a great time with us. Here are some tips for a lake rave.*

📆 **We will be there from 14:00 till next morning. Music starts at 17:00.**

**💦 Tip 1: Bring enough water for yourself**

The weather is not that hot this year, but staying hydrated is important. Please bring at least 1.5 liters of water for yourself. If you have extra space, bring another liter of water for other ravers. We are ravers because we care!

**🧥 Tip 2: If you want to stay overnight, bring warm clothes**

It’s German summer, but the nights can get cold. Bring long pants and a sweater to stay warm. Otherwise, you will have to dance all night to keep warm.

**🍹 Tip 3: Bring enough drinks to get you into the rave mood**

There is no Späti to buy drinks in nature, so if your fun relies on alcohol, bring enough drinks to get yourself into that mood. If you want to be popular at the party, sharing your drinks is always a good idea.

**🥋 Tip 4: Bring a towel or blanket**

If you’d like to swim in the lake or stay until the next morning, a towel is always a perfect option. It can be used for drying your body and can also serve as an extra layer when it’s cold.

**🌭 Tip 5: If you are a snacker and get hungry easily, bring some food**

There will be no restaurants in nature, so if you get hungry easily, bring some food for yourself. Sharing is caring and makes you popular—bringing food for others is always welcome.

**🔐 Tip 6: Keep your belongings safe**

We had incidents last year where some items got stolen. When it’s dark, please make sure your belongings are placed in a secure location.

**❄️ Tip 7: Have fun but also be respectful**

You will be in a public space. We’d appreciate it if certain things stay hidden until darkness. This doesn’t mean you can’t swim naked -- that we encourage it.
