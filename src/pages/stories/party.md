# 🪼 Event: Birthday Lake Rave 🪩

![party people](/images/party.png)

Dear friends,

Summer is coming!!! 🌞 To kick off the party season in Berlin, we are iniviting you to our birthday lake rave party.  

- 📅 **2023-06-03 around 15:00**, opening hours all day and night.
- 📍 **Flughafensee**. Accurate location will be update once we are set. 
- 🔊 If you have a **good sound system**, that would be great if you can bring it.
- 🧺 As denoted in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: *A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.* You can use it as a bag to carry beverages and food, you can use it as a skirt for the dance floor, you can use it to fight off a wild boar at night, you can sit on it if it rains you can sit under it.
- ❄️ **We’d appreciate it if certain things stay hidden till darkness** — it doesn’t mean you can’t swim naked, that we encourage.
- 💦 It's hot today, so don't forget water. **Be hydrate and stay heath!**
- 🧥 Get a **jacket** if you plan to stay till late night.
- 💬 [Join the Telegram group](https://t.me/+aGqvx8fTL1Q3YzE6) and get latest updates.

Yours,

Junyu & Orestis
